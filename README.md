# Multi-Class-Fish-Image-Classification

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify fish species using deep learning models. It compares the performance of a basic CNN and several pretrained models to identify which architecture performs best for fish image classification.

Dataset: Images labeled into 11 fish categories.
Techniques: Custom CNN, data augmentation, pretrained model fine-tuning (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0).
Evaluation: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
